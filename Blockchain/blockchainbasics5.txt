Interacting with the deployed contract:

1. Go to https://remix.ethereum.org
2. Go to run
3. go to 'at address' and paste the contract address to load the  contract from that address.
click the button.
4. It loads the contracts details (ABI), for example the functions, variables.
Now if you perform some operations on the contract. example: setLines and pass some value,
now this function will modify the blockchain, it creates a txn and for that you need to pay.
Metamask window opens, you can set the gas you want to pay and you can submit the txn.

Txn link is generated for exmple:https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0x91ee80c358911fc119bf49ed5fd6e5d86dd9d80c11f34800b3ceaa7fa40f9ecb
we can wait for the txn to be mined. once it has been mined you can check that the operation on
the contract is successful. now if you do a get operation you will get the value which was set.

this txn has been created, generated and signed by the user account created by metamask 
and sent to the contract address.
