Solidity variables:

1. boolean - true/false
    bool public sold;

by default bool is false

2. integers

signed int and unsigned int

signed int can be from int8 to int256
int8 -  means 8bits i.e -128 to 127
int16 i.e -32768 to +32767
int is an alias to int256

unsigned int
uint is an alias to uint256

by default an int is 0

3. there is no support for float/double  in solidity
