Solidity struts:

Struct is a collection of key-value pairs. 
Similar to mappings but the values can have different types. 
Represents a singular thing.

example:
struct Car{
    string brand;
    uint built_year;
    uint value;
}

Car public private_car;

Struct is stored in "STORAGE"


Solidity enums:
Enums are used to create user defined types.
are explicitly convertible to and from int.

enums State{Running, Stopped, Inactive}

State public status = State.Running
