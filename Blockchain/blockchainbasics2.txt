1. EVM (ethereum virtual machine) opcodes

2. WEB3EDEPLOY: 
this is how the contract will be deployed using web3.

3. METAMASK: 
It is a browser plugin that allows users to make ethereum transactions through regular
websites.
It connects regular web to ethereum, it acts like a bridge.
MetaMask is a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed web of tomorrow in your browser 
today. 
It allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a 
full Ethereum node.
Regular browsers don't know how to connect to ethereum nodes and read/write on ethereum blockchain.
MetaMask helps us in doing that.
It injects a library called web3.js into the namespace of each page the browser loads.
Web3 was written by ethereum devs.
