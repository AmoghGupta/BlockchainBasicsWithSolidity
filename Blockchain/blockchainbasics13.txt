Solidity Mappings:

Its a data structure that holds key value pairs, similar to object in JS.
All keys must have same types and all values must have same types.
Mappings are always stored in "STORAGE".

Mappings declared inside functions are also stored in "STORAGE".

we cannot iterate mapping.
its a hash table inside.
unexisting key has a default value.


mapping(key_type=>value_type) access_modifier mapping_name;

mapping(address=>uint) public bids;
