Contract Address:

1. every contract has its own unique Address that is generated at deployment.
2. contract Address is calculated based on the Address of the creator of the contract + no. of txns
of that account(nonce). 
3. Address variable has the following values:
address(this).balance,  // gives the balance of the smart contract // gives in wei
address(this).transfer,
address(this).send,
address(this).call, 
address(this).callcode,
address(this).delegatecall


4. A smart contract can receive ether  and can have an ether balance only if there
is  a payble function defined.

5. Contract receives ether in 2ways:
a. by calling payble function and sending eth with that txn.
b. just by sending eth  to the contract by EOA account, if the contract has a fallback 
payble function.
payble fallback  function is a function without name but payble. the fallback function
can't have args and cant return. there is only one.

6. eth balance of the contract is in posession of anyone  who can call the transfer() built in function.

7. if you try to send ether to a contract that doesn't have payble method
the txn will fail.

1st Method: By EOA

function getbalance() view public returns (uint) {
    return address(this).balance;
}

//fallback payble function
// its a anonymous function since it doesn't have a name
// we can have only one fallback payble function
function () payble public{
    location = "London";
}

//now our smart contract can hold ether balance becuase we have a payble function now

1. get the contract address.
2. go to some EOA where you have some ether and send to the contract address.
3. run getbalance to check the balance


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2nd Method: by calling payble function and sending eth with that txn.

function sendEther() payble public {
    price = 600;
}

1.deploy contract
2. put the value = 200wei
3. run sendEther function
4. run getbalance to check the balance
