Smart contract architecture:

1. 1st instruction is the pragma (version of the compiler)
2. 2nd is Smart contract name (this is not saved with name on blockchain, smart contract
is identified by the contract address generated on deployment)
3. State variables. (saved on ethereum blockchain)
4. constructor (called only once at the time of deployment)
5. member functions contract interface(through which we interact with the contract)
