Variables:
1. its statically typed, you have to give the data types.

2. State variables and local variables.

3. State variables are permanently stored in contract storage, declared at contract level.
These are not dynamically allocated. State variables use storage. 

All state variables need to be created before deployment thats why these are not 
dynamically allocated.

Initialized at declaration using a constructor or after contract deployment by calling setters.
expensive to use as they cost gas.  They are saved on ethereum blockchain.


4. Local variables are at function level. temporary values. Created dynamically.
Struct, Arrays or mappings they take storage memory by default even if they 
are at function level.
If you add a memory keyword then the variables will be allocated at run time. 
memory keywords donot work with state variables.


EVM (ETHEREUM VIRTUAL MACHINE)  has three memories:
1. storage - persistent and expensive like ROM. takes storage on ethereum blockchain.
2. memory - temporary values,free to use. likes RAM
3. stack- holds function variables, free to use
