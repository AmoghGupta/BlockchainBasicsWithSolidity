Solidity functions:

1. functions create the contract interface.
2. 
Setter:  is a function that modifies state variable. Modifies blockchain
function functioName(args list) visibility_specifier{

}

3.
Getter: is function to get values, it doesn't modifies state variable. 
It doesnt modify the blockchain.

function functioName(args list) visibility_specifier view returns(return type){

}


getters are free they are "calls" not "transactions". they don't cost gas.
